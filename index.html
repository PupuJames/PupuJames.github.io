   <h2> 14/12/2021 Afternoon </h2>
   <p> Okay so I knew this was gonna be tough, but never knew this much. Spend the night and morning looking at the chat wallpaper. 
       Its a constant conflict if this decision was right or wrong, but hopefully things will end up getting right.
       Got to know that she had blocked her massi and sparsh from my insta so they can never find me, have mixed feelings about that.
       I keep listening to the songs we used to hear together to distract myself.
       I hate to admit im wrong but what if I am ? I miss her but I will stick to trying to move on for now </p>
   <h2> 14/12/2021 Night </h2>
   <p> She used to ask me about my day and tell me about hers, and giving up that part of the day leaves a big hole, so Im going to use this space to fill up that hole.
      Coz this shit hurts like a bitch. The only thing I keep thinking is that the way she acted in the end saying how we have become incompatible coz
      I didnt just agree to how she wanted to run the both of us, I mean wtf ? Yeah so I went to this party and talked to a lot of people about many things.
      But now I got no one to fucking talk about it. Thanksss Pupu. Coz she made this happen. I hope atleast she will benefit from this, focusing on studies and not me,
      since I was mostly becoming a burden on her. Damn I still cant believe she said how can she ever have feelings for me. I got so mad at that.
      The way she acted like on Monday, I am really stupid in believing she had actual feelings for me even once. I hate what she said. 
      I hate myself for getting this close to someone who doesnt even acknowledge the problems outside of their life, exams and family. How the fuck am I gonna get over this now. </p>
