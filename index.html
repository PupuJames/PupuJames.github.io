   <h2> 14/12/2021 Afternoon </h2>
   <p> Okay so I knew this was gonna be tough, but never knew this much. Spend the night and morning looking at the chat wallpaper. 
       Its a constant conflict if this decision was right or wrong, but hopefully things will end up getting right.
       Got to know that she had blocked her massi and sparsh from my insta so they can never find me, have mixed feelings about that.
       I keep listening to the songs we used to hear together to distract myself.
       I hate to admit im wrong but what if I am ? I miss her but I will stick to trying to move on for now </p>
   <h2> 14/12/2021 Night </h2>
   <p> She used to ask me about my day and tell me about hers, and giving up that part of the day leaves a big hole, so Im going to use this space to fill up that hole.
      Coz this shit hurts like a bitch. The only thing I keep thinking is that the way she acted in the end saying how we have become incompatible coz
      I didnt just agree to how she wanted to run the both of us, I mean wtf ? Yeah so I went to this party and talked to a lot of people about many things.
      But now I got no one to fucking talk about it. Thanksss Pupu. Coz she made this happen. I hope atleast she will benefit from this, focusing on studies and not me,
      since I was mostly becoming a burden on her. Damn I still cant believe she said how can she ever have feelings for me. I got so mad at that.
      The way she acted like on Monday, I am really stupid in believing she had actual feelings for me even once. I hate what she said. 
      I hate myself for getting this close to someone who doesnt even acknowledge the problems outside of their life, exams and family. How the fuck am I gonna get over this now. </p>
   <h2> 15/12/2021 Night </h2>
   <p> Can you believe this girl ? She told me so much that she loves me and all sorts of things and that she will come back to me if I ever get mad,
      but nowhere to be seen now. Like nowhere, nope, nada. I have been angry at what she said and how she treated me and missing her so the fuck much, 
      but does she care ? Probably not. Maybe I should come to terms with the fact that what I was told were lies, and there is no point in waiting for her.
      Maybe I should stop all this, try to move on for real coz that gola has rolled over. Situation is detiorating everyday and she be probably back on tinder again. </p>
   <h2> 16/12/2021 Eve </h2>
   <p> Okay im sick of ittt now. She really wants to go this way huh. Fine. Fucking Fine. But I cant just have her last memory to be that of Monday.
      If she doesnt call me by tonight, Im going to go to her place soon. See her off properly, idk. Get some closure of sorts. Fucking disappointed. </p>
